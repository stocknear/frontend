  "faq_q5_title": "5. Why do other platforms show options data that Stocknear doesn't?",
  "faq_q5_answer": "We focus on unusual options activity from hedge funds and institutional traders. Retail investor contracts are excluded to eliminate noise and highlight significant market moves.",
  "faq_q6_title": "6. Is Dark Pool data real-time or delayed?",
  "faq_q6_answer": "Dark Pool data is delayed by 15 minutes. We partner with major exchanges to provide exclusive Wall Street insights typically reserved for institutional traders.",

  "faq_q7_answer_1": "Please email {email}, and we'll investigate immediately.",
