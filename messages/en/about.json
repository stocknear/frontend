  "about_seo_title": "About Stocknear — Stock Research That Doesn't Suck",
  "about_seo_description": "Stocknear gives everyday investors the same data hedge funds use. Built by a physicist who got tired of bad tools. No ads, no sponsored picks, just clean data.",
  "about_hero_title": "We're building the stock research platform we wished existed",
  "about_hero_description": "Wall Street has had an unfair data advantage for decades. We're changing that — one data point at a time.",

  "about_story_label": "Our Story",
  "about_story_title": "Born from frustration, built with rigor",
  "about_story_paragraph_1": "Stocknear exists because the tools available to regular investors were, frankly, terrible. Overpriced terminals. Ad-infested screeners. \"Free\" platforms making money by selling your data or pushing sponsored picks.",
  "about_story_paragraph_2": "Our founder came from physics — used to working with clean datasets and rigorous analysis. When he started investing and saw what retail investors were stuck with, the gap was hard to ignore. Hedge funds had options flow, dark pool data, insider transactions, and real-time analytics. Everyone else got delayed quotes and banner ads.",
  "about_story_paragraph_3": "So we built something better. No venture capital telling us what to prioritize. No advertisers deciding what appears on your screen. Just the data — presented clearly, updated fast, at the absolute lowest price point in the entire industry. Because the goal was always to help the little guy, not extract from them.",
  "about_believe_label": "What We Believe",
  "about_believe_title": "Opinions we're not afraid to have",
  "about_believe_1_title": "Data should be accurate, or it shouldn't exist.",
  "about_believe_1_description": "We use the same vendors that serve hedge funds. Every number on Stocknear traces back to a verified source — SEC filings, OPRA feeds, licensed financial databases. If we can't verify it, we don't show it.",
  "about_believe_2_title": "Your attention isn't our product.",
  "about_believe_2_description": "Zero ads. Zero sponsored stocks. Zero \"hot picks.\" You're paying for data, not subsidizing someone else's promotion budget.",
  "about_believe_3_title": "Fast isn't a feature — it's the baseline.",
  "about_believe_3_description": "Markets don't wait. Every page, chart, and data point on Stocknear loads instantly because anything slower is a missed opportunity.",
  "about_believe_4_title": "You decide what we build next.",
  "about_believe_4_description": "Our roadmap comes from user feedback and our Discord community — not a board of directors. If a feature doesn't serve investors, it doesn't get built.",
  "about_cta_badge": "10,000+ investors and counting",
  "about_cta_title": "See what real stock research looks like",
