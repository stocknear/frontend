                Any feature advertised as “unlimited” is provided for normal,
                human usage only. We deploy technical safeguards—such as rate
                limits, session throttling, CAPTCHAs, and download quotas—to
                prevent automated scraping or abusive behavior. You agree not to
                bypass these protections or script large-scale data extraction.<br

                Stocknear may, at its sole discretion, temporarily pause or permanently
                suspend access (including paid subscriptions) when activity is suspected
                to be abusive, threatens platform stability, or violates these Terms.
                Repeated or egregious violations can lead to account termination
                and forfeiture of remaining subscription time without refund.

                We may offer subscription services via Lemon Squeezy. Specific
                terms related to subscriptions will be presented at the time of
                purchase, and by subscribing, you agree to those terms.<br /><br
                />
                Subscription fees are charged in advance and will automatically renew
                for the period initially selected, unless you notify us of your intention
                to cancel.<br /><br />
                Cancellation can be managed through the billing portal in your Account
                Settings or by contacting us at
                <a

                >.<br /><br />
                If you are not completely satisfied with your subscription, you may
                request a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase. Please
                note, however, that each user is eligible for a refund only once;
                subsequent purchases will not be eligible for a refund. This policy
                is intended to prevent abuse of our refund program and ensure fairness
                to all customers. Refund requests made after 30 days will not be
                eligible.<br /><br />
                If you purchase multiple subscriptions, you will be liable for all
                associated fees, including duplicate charges, and Stocknear is under
                no obligation to provide additional refunds beyond the single refund
                described above.

                pricing will be communicated to you and will take effect
                immediately upon notification. You may cancel your membership
                during the notice period to avoid future charges.
