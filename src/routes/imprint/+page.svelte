                The free and freely accessible content of this website has been
                created with the greatest possible care, but the provider of
                this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of
                the free and freely accessible journalistic advice and news.
                Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the
                respective author and not always the opinion of the provider.
                Simply by calling up the free and freely accessible content, no
                contractual relationship is established between the user and the
                provider; in this respect, there is no intention on the part of
                the provider to be legally bound.

                This website contains links to third-party websites ("external
                links"). These websites are subject to the liability of the
                respective operators. When the external links were first
                created, the provider checked the external content for any legal
                violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The
                provider has no influence on the current and future design and
                content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links
                does not imply that the provider adopts the content behind the
                reference or link as its own. A constant control of the external
                links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete
                evidence of violations. However, in the event of knowledge of
                legal violations, such external links will be deleted
                immediately.
