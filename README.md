# Getting started
Coming soon to run stocknear locally on your machine.

# Contributing
Stocknear is open-source software and you're welcome to contribute to its development.

The core idea of stocknear shall always be: ***Fast*** & ***Simple***.

If want to contribute to the codebase please follow these guidelines:
- Refactoring slow code into fast code is a huge plus!
- Reducing complexity and increasing simplicity/readability is a huge plus!
- If your PR looks "complex", is a big diff, or adds lots of lines, it won't be reviewed or merged. Consider breaking it up into smaller PRs that are individually clear wins. A common pattern I see is prerequisite refactors before adding new functionality. If you can (cleanly) refactor to the point that the feature is a 3 line change, this is great, and something easy for us to review.
